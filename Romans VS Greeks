Long ago , there was a war between the Romans and Greeks.The Roman and Greek armies meet outside the walls of Florence. Seeing the bloodshed the two kings to decide to end the battle as early as possible as both the armies suffer a lot.
The shape of the battle ground is Square. To win the war is to conquer the flag first by the opposite army , it has been decided to place the flag post at the exact center of the battle field. Can you please help them in placing the flag post at the exact center? Given the coordinates of the left bottom vertex of the square ground and the length of the side of the battle field, you need to write a program to determine the coordinates of the centre of the ground. 
[Assumption --- Length of the side is always even] 

Input & Output Format:

Input consists of three integers

First input consists of x coordinate

Second input consists of y coordinate

Third input consists of the length.

The output consists of the two integers.

#include<iostream>
#include<cmath>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int a,b,c;
    cin >> a >> b >> c;
    int x1,y1,x2,y2;
    x1=a;
    x2=a+c;
    y1=b;
    y2=b+c;
    cout << (x1+x2)/2 << "\t" << (y1+y2)/2;
    return 0;
}
